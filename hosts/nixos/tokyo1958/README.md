This is work-in-progress NixOS configuration for my gaming desktop.

I grew up on Windows and switched from a hybrid Windows/Linux setup
to MacOS for professional use in 2016. I have maintained a Windows
environment for gaming since then, with gaming being the only reason
for using the operating system at all.

I have been pretty impressed with my Steam Deck, so I'm exploring a
shift off of Windows altogether. Depending on how it goes, I may
end up moving from MacOS to Linux in work as well.

For the moment, this is a standalone configuration, because my
immediate effort to adopt my modified dustinlyons setup was
unsuccessful.

Most of those issues seem related to my AMD iGPU + NVIDIA GPU
setup making Hyprland unhappy. So I'm starting from scratch,
and will aim to integrate more of my MacOS shell environment and
desktop applications as I get things working.

## Manual steps
Install protonup impurely:
```shell
protonup
```
